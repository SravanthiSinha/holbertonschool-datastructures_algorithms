# 0x06. C - Graphs

## System programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms


* 0-graph_create.c - Contains a function that allocates memory to store a graph_t structure, and initializes its content

* 1-graph_add_vertex.c - Contains a function that adds a vertex to an existing graph

* 2-graph_add_edge.c - Contains a function that adds an edge to an existing graph

* 3-graph_delete.c - Contains a function that deletes a graph

* 4-depth_first_traverse.c - Contains a function that traverses the graph  in dfs way and returns the depth of the graph

* 5-breadth_first_traverse.c - Contains a function that traverses the graph  in bfs way and returns the depth of the graph

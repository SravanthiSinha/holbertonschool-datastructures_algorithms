# System programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms 

This repository contains projects for training in the Data structures and Algorithms  track  at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). All projects are in C and are designed to learn C from a beginners level to the advanced level. 

## Styling and Specifications
All C programs are complied with gcc 4.8 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. They comply with [schools formatting checker](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty), based on [Linux Kernel coding style]. All programs were written from the Bash, using Emacs. 

### Compilation
All programs must compile with gcc, using with the flags below:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.##.c ##-name.c
```
### Directories
Each directory is named after a concept and contains ordered exercises from mandatory to advance level, and a README.md with a short description of its files.
